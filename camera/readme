Download and put the camera.urdf somewhere convenient. 

Can be added to already running Gazebo sim using:
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `pwd`<put the camera.urdf file directory address here> -urdf -x 0 -y 0 -z 5 -P 1.57  -model <name of model>

-x -y -z can be changed to adjust the position of the camera.

After adding the camera to the environment, it will start a topic camera1/image_raw. 
The video can be viewed using rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view image:=/camera1.

Rostopic echo will only return a chain of numbers. The message type is ROS image. Will need to convert with ROS cv_bridge package into OpenCV images.

## Project Description - Chess-played Robotic Arm
In this project, chess-played robotic arm was build to compete and play against human physically so that the player can achieve the real experience even when playing it individually. We decided to go for full-simulation of chess-played robotic arm as a proof of concept which could be potentially being further develop into the real physical chess-played robotic arm. The robots is build from scratch and it is made possible thank you to the combination and help of various open source contributor. Although we might not be able to achieve the perfect chess-played robotic arm, we hope that this could help others as well. 

Below we will discuss each part of the Chess-played robotic arm and also the issue that we encountered so that it could be improve further.

Here is the overview of the chess-played robotic arm with the chessboard
